1.What is a trait ? when to use ? 
A trait is a concept primarily used in some programming languages like Scala and Rust. It represents a reusable set of methods and fields that
 can be mixed into a class to provide additional behavior or functionality.

When to use traits:

Code Reusability: Traits allow you to define common functionality once and reuse it across multiple classes, reducing code duplication.
Modularity: Traits help in breaking down large classes into smaller, more manageable pieces by grouping related behavior together.
Composition over Inheritance: Traits promote composition-based design over inheritance, allowing you to mix multiple traits into a class,
 providing flexibility and avoiding the limitations of traditional inheritance.
Avoiding Diamond Problem: Traits offer a solution to the diamond problem (a common issue in multiple inheritance scenarios) by enforcing linearization
 rules, ensuring a clear and predictable method resolution order.
Overall, traits are useful when you need to define reusable components of behavior that can be combined flexibly to create new classes with desired 
functionality

2.Difference between trait and sealed trait?
Trait: A trait in Scala is similar to an interface in Java. It defines a reusable set of methods and fields that can be mixed into classes to provide
 additional behavior. Traits can be extended by classes or other traits, and they support multiple inheritance.

Sealed Trait: A sealed trait is a special kind of trait in Scala that restricts inheritance to only the same file or package where it's defined. 
It means that all classes or traits that extend a sealed trait must be in the same file or package. Sealed traits are often used in pattern matching to ensure exhaustiveness, where all possible cases are explicitly handled.

In short, while both traits and sealed traits are used for defining reusable behavior, 
a sealed trait has the additional restriction of limiting inheritance to a specific scope, typically for enhancing pattern matching and ensuring 
code safety.

3.What is an abstract class? 
An abstract class in programming is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and typically contains one or more abstract methods, 
which are methods without a body. Abstract classes are designed to be subclassed, and they serve as a template for concrete subclasses to implement 
their own versions of the abstract methods. Abstract classes can also contain concrete methods with implementations, providing common functionality 
to their subclasses.

4.What is the difference between an java interface and a scala trait?
Java Interface:
Interfaces in Java are used to define a contract for classes. They can contain method signatures, 
constant declarations (which are implicitly public, static, and final), and default methods (with implementation) introduced in Java 8.
Interfaces cannot contain fields (instance variables).
All methods in interfaces are implicitly public and abstract.
Java interfaces support multiple inheritance, meaning a class can implement multiple interfaces.
Classes implementing an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the interface.
Interfaces are often used for achieving abstraction and providing a way to achieve multiple inheritances in Java.
Scala Trait: 
Traits in Scala are similar to interfaces in Java but are more powerful and flexible.
Traits can contain method signatures, concrete method implementations, and fields (instance variables).
Traits can also define state (fields) and provide behavior (method implementations).
Traits support multiple inheritance, allowing a class to extend multiple traits.
Traits can be mixed into classes using the with keyword, providing a way to compose behavior and reuse code.
Unlike Java interfaces, traits in Scala can have constructors, which allow them to accept parameters during instantiation.
Traits are often used in Scala for mixin composition, defining reusable code, and providing a way to extend classes without subclassing.
In summary, while both Java interfaces and Scala traits serve as contracts for classes and support multiple inheritance, Scala traits offer 
additional features such as concrete method implementations, fields, state, and constructor parameters, making them more powerful and flexible than 
Java interfaces.

5.What is a singleton 
A singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to only one instance. In other words, it ensures that a class has only 
a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is commonly used when exactly one object is needed to 
coordinate actions across the system, such as a database connection pool, logging service, or configuration manager.

Key characteristics of a singleton pattern include:
Private Constructor: The class has a private constructor to prevent external instantiation.
Static Method: It provides a static method to access the single instance of the class.
Lazy Initialization: The instance is typically created only when it's first requested, using lazy initialization to defer the creation until needed.
Thread Safety: In multithreaded environments, the singleton implementation should be thread-safe to ensure that only one instance is created even 
in concurrent scenarios.
Singletons are widely used in various programming languages to manage global state or resources and to ensure that there's only one instance 
of a particular class throughout the application. However, 
it's important to use singletons judiciously, as they can introduce tight coupling and make unit testing more difficult.

6.What is a higher order function?
A higher-order function is a function that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. In other words, 
it treats functions as first-class citizens.

Taking Functions as Arguments: A higher-order function can accept one or more functions as parameters. These functions can then be invoked or passed 
to other functions within the body of the higher-order function.

Returning Functions as Results: A higher-order function can generate and return new functions as results. These returned functions can then be 
invoked elsewhere in the program.

Higher-order functions enable powerful abstractions and facilitate code reuse by allowing behavior to be parameterized and encapsulated within 
functions. They are commonly used in functional programming paradigms and are prevalent in languages like Python, JavaScript, and Scala.

7.What is a closure 
A closure is a function that captures and retains references to variables from the scope in which it was defined, 
even after that scope has finished executing. In other words, a closure "closes over" its surrounding lexical environment, allowing it to access and manipulate variables that are not directly passed as parameters.

Key characteristics of closures include:
Access to Outer Variables: Closures have access to variables from their containing scope, including variables defined in the outer function or 
the global scope.
Retaining State: Closures retain access to the variables' values at the time of their creation, even if those variables are no longer in scope.
Encapsulation: Closures encapsulate both the code and the environment in which they were created, allowing for private data and behavior.
Closures are commonly used in languages that support first-class functions, such as JavaScript and Python, to create functions with persistent 
state or to implement callbacks and event handlers. They provide a powerful mechanism for creating modular and encapsulated code.

8.What is a companion object? What rae the advantages ? example
In Scala, a companion object is an object that shares the same name as a class and is defined in the same file. 
It serves as a companion to the class, providing a place for static methods, constants, and other shared functionality related to the class.
Advantages of companion objects include:
Shared Access: Companion objects and classes can access each other's private members, enabling seamless interaction between them.
Static-like Behavior: Companion objects can contain static methods and constants that are shared across instances of the class, providing 
a convenient place for utility functions or factory methods.
Factory Methods: They can serve as factory methods for creating instances of the associated class, providing more descriptive and flexible ways
 to construct objects.
Enhanced Readability: Using companion objects can improve code readability by grouping related functionality together and providing clear 
separation between instance-specific and shared behavior
class Person(name: String, age: Int)

object Person {
  // Factory method to create Person instances
  def apply(name: String, age: Int): Person = new Person(name, age)
  
  // Static method to calculate the average age of a list of persons
  def averageAge(people: List[Person]): Double = {
    if (people.isEmpty) 0
    else people.map(_.age).sum.toDouble / people.length
  }
}

// Usage
val person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
val person2 = Person("Bob", 25)
val person3 = Person("Charlie", 35)

val people = List(person1, person2, person3)
val avgAge = Person.averageAge(people)
println(s"Average age: $avgAge")
In this example, the Person class represents individuals with a name and an age. The companion object Person contains a factory method apply for 
creating Person instances and a static method averageAge to calculate the average age of a list of persons.
These shared functionalities are conveniently encapsulated within the companion object.

9.Nil vs Null vs null vs Nothing vs None vs Unit 
Nil: In Scala, Nil is an empty list of a specific type. It represents the end of a list and is often used as a base case for list operations.
 It's similar to an empty array in other languages.

Null: Null is a reference type in Scala that represents a null reference. It's used to denote that a reference does not refer to any object.
 However, its usage is discouraged in Scala because it can lead to null pointer exceptions.

null: Lowercase null is the actual null value used in Java and Scala to represent a reference that points to no object. It's the same as null in Java.

Nothing: Nothing is a bottom type in Scala, which means it is a subtype of every other type. It represents a value that never exists, 
such as a function that never returns or an expression that always throws an exception. It's often used to signal abnormal termination.

None: None is an option type in Scala that represents a lack of a value. It's used in conjunction with Some to represent optional values in 
a type-safe manner. None is typically used to signify the absence of a value.

Unit: Unit is a type in Scala that represents the absence of a meaningful value. It's similar to void in Java or C and is often used as the 
return type of functions that perform side effects without returning a meaningful result.

10.What is pure function?

A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always produce the same output and has no side effects. In other words:
Deterministic: The function always returns the same result for the same set of inputs. There are no random elements or external dependencies involved.
No Side Effects: The function does not modify any state outside of its scope. It does not mutate variables, modify global state, or perform 
any I/O operations.
Pure functions are predictable, easy to test, and enable referential transparency, meaning you can replace a function call with its result 
without changing the program's behavior.

11.What is SBT and how have you used it? 
SBT (Simple Build Tool) is a build tool for Scala projects. It's similar to Maven or Gradle but specifically designed for Scala. 
SBT uses a DSL (Domain Specific Language) based on Scala syntax for defining build tasks and managing project dependencies.

Here's how I've used SBT:
Project Setup: I've used SBT to initialize new Scala projects by creating the necessary project structure, including source directories, 
configuration files, and build definitions.
Dependency Management: SBT allows you to declare project dependencies in a simple and concise way. I've specified dependencies in the
 build.sbt file and let SBT handle the resolution and retrieval of dependencies from repositories.
Building and Packaging: SBT provides commands for compiling Scala code, running tests, and packaging applications into JAR files or other 
distribution formats. I've used SBT to build and package Scala projects for deployment.
Task Customization: SBT allows you to define custom tasks and settings using its DSL. I've customized build tasks to automate repetitive tasks, 
perform code quality checks, or integrate with other tools.
Overall, SBT simplifies the build process for Scala projects and provides powerful features for managing dependencies, building, testing, 
and deploying applications.

12.What is currying?
Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, 
each taking a single argument. In Scala, currying is achieved by defining a function with multiple parameter lists.
def add(x: Int)(y: Int): Int = x + y

// Curried function
val addCurried = add(5) _ // Partially apply the first argument
// Usage
val result = addCurried(3) // Pass the second argument
println(result) // Output: 8
In this example, the add function is defined with two parameter lists. When partially applying the function with the first argument (add(5)), 
it returns a function that takes the second argument. 
This allows for partial application and greater flexibility when working with functions.

13.Difference between currying and higher-order functions

Currying and higher-order functions are both advanced functional programming concepts in Scala, but they serve different purposes:

Currying:

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
It allows you to partially apply a function by fixing some of its arguments, returning a function that takes the remaining arguments.
Currying enables more flexible function composition and facilitates creating specialized versions of functions.
Higher-Order Functions:

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
They enable abstraction over actions, allowing you to pass behavior as parameters or encapsulate behavior into functions.
Higher-order functions facilitate code reuse, modularity, and expressive programming constructs like map, filter, and reduce.
In essence, currying deals with transforming the structure of functions, while higher-order functions deal with functions as values and enable 
composability and abstraction.

14.Difference between var and val?
In simple terms:
var: Mutable variable. Its value can be reassigned.
val: Immutable variable. Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.

15.What is case class?
A case class in Scala is a special type of class that is primarily used to store and transfer data. It is called a "case" class because it 
is often used in pattern matching, where each case corresponds to a specific pattern.

Key features of case classes include:

Automatic Property Accessors: By default, case classes automatically define getter methods for their constructor parameters, 
allowing you to access their properties directly.

Immutability: Case classes are immutable by default, meaning their instances cannot be modified after they are created.

Pattern Matching: Case classes are commonly used in pattern matching expressions, where each case represents a specific pattern to match against.

Companion Object with Factory Methods: Case classes automatically generate a companion object with apply methods, providing 
convenient factory methods for creating instances of the case class without using the new keyword.

Structural Equality: Case classes implement structural equality, meaning instances with the same property values are considered equal.

Example of a case class:

scala
Copy code
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
With this definition, you can create instances of the Person class and access their properties using dot notation. 
Additionally, you can use pattern matching to destructure Person instances.

16.Why/when to use case class? Example

Case classes are particularly useful in Scala for modeling immutable data structures, such as records or entities. 
Here's why and when you might use case classes:
Immutable Data: Case classes are immutable by default, meaning their instances cannot be modified after creation. 
This makes them suitable for representing data that shouldn't change over time.
Pattern Matching: Case classes are commonly used in pattern matching expressions, where each case represents a specific pattern to match against.
 They make pattern matching more concise and readable.
Automatic Property Accessors: Case classes automatically generate getter methods for their constructor parameters, 
allowing you to access properties directly.
Structural Equality: Case classes implement structural equality, meaning instances with the same property values are considered equal. 
This simplifies equality comparison.
Companion Object with Factory Methods: Case classes automatically generate a companion object with apply methods,
providing convenient factory methods for creating instances of the case class without using the new keyword.

Example:

// Define a case class representing a person
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

// Create instances of Person
val person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
val person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

// Access properties directly
println(person1.name) // Output: Alice
println(person2.age)  // Output: 25

// Pattern matching with case classes
def greet(person: Person): String = person match {
  case Person("Alice", _) => "Hello, Alice!"
  case Person("Bob", _) => "Hello, Bob!"
  case _ => "Hello, stranger!"
}

println(greet(person1)) // Output: Hello, Alice!
println(greet(person2)) // Output: Hello, Bob!
In this example, the Person case class is used to represent individuals with a name and age. 
Instances of Person are created and pattern matched against in the greet function.

17.Difference between case class and normal class?
The main differences between case classes and normal classes in Scala are:
Boilerplate Code: Case classes automatically generate methods for property access, equality, and hash code, reducing the need for boilerplate code 
compared to normal classes.
Immutability: Case classes are immutable by default, while normal classes can be mutable unless explicitly declared as immutable.
Pattern Matching: Case classes are designed to work seamlessly with pattern matching, making them convenient for destructuring and matching against
 their properties.
Structural Equality: Case classes implement structural equality by default, meaning two instances are considered equal if their properties are the same.
 Normal classes require explicit implementation of equals and hashCode methods for equality comparison.
Companion Object: Case classes automatically generate a companion object with factory methods for easy instantiation, while normal classes require 
explicit definition of companion objects if needed.
Overall, case classes are optimized for scenarios where you need to define simple, immutable data structures with minimal boilerplate code and 
seamless integration with pattern matching. Normal classes provide more flexibility and control but may require more boilerplate code for common tasks.

18.Scala type hierarchy?
In Scala, the type hierarchy is organized as follows:

Any: The root type of all Scala types.
AnyVal: The parent type of all value types.
Boolean: Represents true or false values.
Byte: Represents 8-bit signed integers.
Short: Represents 16-bit signed integers.
Int: Represents 32-bit signed integers.
Long: Represents 64-bit signed integers.
Float: Represents 32-bit floating point numbers.
Double: Represents 64-bit floating point numbers.
Char: Represents 16-bit Unicode characters.
Unit: Represents the absence of a meaningful value, similar to void in Java.
AnyRef: The parent type of all reference types.
Scala Objects: Scala classes, case classes, traits, and other user-defined types.
Java Objects: Java classes and objects.
Null: Represents a null reference.
Nothing: Represents a value that never exists, used as a subtype of all types.
This hierarchy allows Scala to have a unified type system where both primitive and reference types are treated uniformly.

19.What are partially applied functions?
Partially applied functions are functions that are not called with all of their arguments. Instead, you provide some, but not all, 
of the required arguments, which creates a new function that takes the remaining arguments. This is particularly useful when you want to create 
specialized versions of a function without having to redefine it entirely. It allows for more flexibility and code reuse.

For example, consider a function add that takes two arguments:

def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
You can partially apply this function by fixing one of the arguments:

val add2 = add(2, _: Int) // Partially applying the first argument
val add3 = add(_: Int, 3) // Partially applying the second argument
Now add2 is a function that adds 2 to its argument, and add3 is a function that adds 3 to its argument.

20.What is tail recursion.
Tail recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself as its last action, with the return value of the recursive call being 
immediately returned by the outer call. This means there are no pending operations to perform after the recursive call returns, making it possible 
for the compiler to optimize the recursion into an iterative loop, which can improve performance and prevent stack overflow errors for deep recursive 
calls.
In short, tail recursion allows for efficient iteration using recursion.

Here's an example of a tail-recursive function in Scala that calculates the factorial of a number:
def factorial(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int = {
  if (n <= 1) acc
  else factorial(n - 1, n * acc)
}
In this example, the recursive call factorial(n - 1, n * acc) is the last operation performed by the function, making it tail-recursive.
