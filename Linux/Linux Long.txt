To count the number of occurrences of a specific word in a file using the command line, you can use the combination of grep and wc commands:
grep -o 'word' filename | wc -l
Replace 'word' with the specific word you want to count, and filename with the name of the file.
Here's how the command works:
grep -o 'word' filename: This command searches for the specified word in the file and outputs each occurrence of the word on a separate line using the -o option.
wc -l: This command counts the number of lines. Since each occurrence of the word is on a separate line, counting the lines gives the total number 
of occurrences of the word

5. How do you find and replace a specific word in a file using the command line?

You can use the sed command in the following way to find and replace a specific word in a file:

Replace /path/to/directory with the directory where you want to start the search. This command will recursively search in the specified 
directory and its subdirectories for files with the .txt extension.

15. How do you create a backup of a file with a timestamp in its filename using the command line?
To create a backup of a file with a timestamp in its filename using the command line, you can use the cp command along with date command to
generate the timestamp. Here's a command you can use:
cp /path/to/original/file /path/to/backup/directory/$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S')_filename.extension
Replace /path/to/original/file with the path to the original file, /path/to/backup/directory/ with the path to the directory where you want to
store the backup, filename.extension with the name of the original file and its extension.
For example, if you have a file named example.txt located in /home/user/Documents, and you want to create a backup in /home/user/Backups, 
you can use the following command:
cp /home/user/Documents/example.txt /home/user/Backups/$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S')_example.txt

If you only want to display the IP address and subnet mask of a specific interface, you can specify the interface name. For example, 
to show the configuration for the eth0 interface:
ip addr show eth0
Alternatively, you can use the deprecated ifconfig command, but it's recommended to use ip command for more modern systems:
ifconfig
This will also display network interface configuration, including IP addresses and subnet masks.
Choose the appropriate command based on your system and preferences.

18. How do you create a new user with a specific home directory and set their password using the command line?
To create a new user with a specific home directory and set their password using the command line, you can use the useradd and passwd commands. 
Here's how to do it:
Use the useradd command to create a new user with the desired home directory:
sudo useradd -m -d /path/to/home/directory username
Replace /path/to/home/directory with the desired home directory path and username with the username you want to create.
Set a password for the new user using the passwd command:
sudo passwd username
Replace username with the username you created in step 1. You will be prompted to enter and confirm the password for the new user.

It will display information such as total size, used space, available space, and filesystem type for each mounted filesystem.

20. How do you schedule a command or script to run at a specific time using the cron system?
To schedule a command or script to run at a specific time using the cron system, you can follow these steps:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Use the crontab -e command to edit your user's crontab file. This file contains the list of scheduled tasks for your user.
Add a new line to the crontab file with the scheduling information and the command you want to run.
The syntax for scheduling tasks in cron is as follows:
minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command_to_run

Here's what each field represents:
minute: The minute when the command should run (0-59).

hour: The hour when the command should run (0-23).
day_of_month: The day of the month when the command should run (1-31).
month: The month when the command should run (1-12 or Jan-Dec).
day_of_week: The day of the week when the command should run (0-6 or Sun-Sat, where 0 and 7 represent Sunday).
For example, to schedule a script named myscript.sh to run every day at 8:00 AM, you would add the following line to your crontab file:

0 8 * * * /path/to/myscript.sh
Save and close the crontab file. Your scheduled task will now run according to the specified schedule.
Note: Make sure to replace /path/to/myscript.sh with the actual path to your script file. Additionally, 
cron uses the system's timezone for scheduling tasks, so keep that in mind when specifying the time.
